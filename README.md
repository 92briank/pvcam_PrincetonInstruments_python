# PythonPrincetonCamera
pvcam32 dll import to python
used to drive a PIXIS 1024 on windows 7 32 bits.

Also tested on a Pixis 256 (CHIP_NAME = 'EEV  256x1024BR') connected with USB on windows XP 32 bits.
Quickly tested on a InGaAs (CHIP_NAME = 'InGaAS    1x1024') PDA connected to a ST133 with USB on windows XP 32 bits.

This version is based on https://github.com/lauracorman/PythonPrincetonCamera. It tries to keep the class's functions compatibles to Laura Corman but add features. It also include a subclass for Pixis 256 as an example.
